# Discover Code Vulnerabilities with Snyk

**Introduction to Snyk**

Snyk serves as a security platform with a developer-centric approach, aiding organizations in detecting and rectifying vulnerabilities present in their open-source code and containers. By seamlessly integrating security measures into the development cycle, Snyk empowers developers to proactively pinpoint and resolve security concerns at the early stages of software development. This platform equips developers with the necessary tools and strategies to effectively oversee open-source dependencies, detect potential vulnerabilities, and establish a secure foundation for their codebase and applications.

**Snyk encompasses several notable features:**
* **Dependability Scrutiny**: Snyk meticulously scans your codebase, pinpointing vulnerabilities within your open-source dependencies. It provides comprehensive insights into dependencies harboring security concerns and presents actionable steps to rectify them.
  
* **Container Vigilance**: Snyk extends its scrutiny to container images, systematically scanning for vulnerabilities. This scrutiny ensures that the utilized images remain shielded from well-known security hazards.

* **Persistent Surveillance**: Through continuous monitoring, Snyk vigilantly watches over your dependencies and containers. It promptly alerts you to any newly discovered vulnerabilities that might impact your projects.

* **Resolution and Correction**: Snyk acts as a guiding hand in addressing vulnerabilities, offering guidance on the necessary fixes. It often suggests patches or updates to counteract security risks, and even proposes alternative package versions that remain unexposed to vulnerabilities.

* **Harmonized Tool Integration**: Snyk seamlessly integrates into an array of development tools, encompassing code repositories, CI/CD pipelines, and issue tracking systems. This unobtrusive integration facilitates the effortless inclusion of security checks within the development workflow.

* **Security Frameworks**: Organizations can configure security protocols that delineate acceptable risk levels and automate the enforcement of security measures.

* **Developer-Centric Approach**: Designed with developers in mind, Snyk embeds security seamlessly into the development process. It offers lucid and actionable insights to empower developers in understanding and remedying vulnerabilities.

* **Broad Compatibility**: Snyk caters to a broad spectrum of programming languages and package managers extensively employed in software development.

Snyk plays a pivotal role in enhancing the security of organizational software products. By preemptively addressing vulnerabilities, it significantly curtails the exposure to security breaches and data breaches. This aligns with the overarching trend of infusing security practices into DevOps and continuous delivery pipelines, fostering a more robust and secure software development paradigm.

**Purpose of Snyk**

Snyk's main purpose is to help people who create software, like developers and teams, to find and fix problems that could make their software not safe. It does this by checking the code they write, the things they use from others, and the special parts of their software. Here's how Snyk works:

1. Vulnerability Detection: Snyk looks at the software's parts and spots places where bad things could happen if someone tries to break in.   
2. Early Fixes: It helps fix problems early, so they don't become big issues later that are harder to fix.
3. Helping Everyone: Even if people aren't experts in security, Snyk makes sure they understand what's wrong and how to make it right.
4. Watching Open Source: For people who share their code with others, Snyk helps them keep it safe and reliable.
5. Guiding Solutions: Snyk gives advice on how to make things better and safer, like using special pieces or changing things slightly.
6. Fitting In Everywhere: It's easy to use with all the tools developers work with, so they can check for safety while building.
7. Following Rules: Snyk helps teams follow the rules about security and make sure their software does what it's supposed to do.
8. Always Alert: It keeps watching for any new problems, so they can be fixed as soon as they're found.
9. Covering Special Parts: Snyk also helps with new and special types of software, like the ones that use tiny pieces and containers.

So, Snyk's big goal is to help everyone who makes software work together to make sure it's safe and free from problems that could cause harm.
